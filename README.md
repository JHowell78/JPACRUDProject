## Week : 9 Project for Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp

### Spring/MVC JPA CRUD Project

This projects purpose was to get our feet wet in basic how basic HTML webpages work.  The concepts we used were/are the basics of how to build a webpage using HTML and it's various tags.


### New Techniques Used

* HTML tags
* embedded images and videos
* Formatting text in HTML
* Ordered (numbered) lists and unordered lists

### Technologies Used

* Eclipse
* Git
* Atom
* Command line/terminal

### Plan of Attack

This project was more in line with following directions and using some trial and error as to what works. It was a complete 180 from the past 6 weeks of java, but at the same time nice to be able to see some GUI results on a webpage in comparison to what java will give you in a console environment.  I am excited to see where the next few weeks will go and expand on this further.
