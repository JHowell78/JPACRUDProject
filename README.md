## Week : 9 Project for Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp

### Spring/MVC JPA CRUD Project

This is my first solo full-stack web application project. It is based off of a database that I created. The websites purpose is to give the user information to various entertainment venues (location, seating capacity, etc..).  

### How it works

The user is presented with a home page that lists all the venues in the database. At the top they have the option to search a venue by its ID number or add a new venue. If a user selects a venue they are taken to that venues information page. On that page they have the options to edit or delete that venue. They also have the option of going back to the home page.  If a user chooses to create a new venue and then submits it that venue is now able to be seen from the home page with the rest of the venues.

### Plan of Attack

This project was more difficult for me because there wasn't a clearly defined project.  Which at the same time was nice because I had the freedom to do a website on something that interests me.  Once I picked my topic I flushed out my initial database and then worked on connecting it to my Spring Tools Suite. After I confirmed I could read the data I began to design the layout and functionality of the site. Everything went fairly well, but I do need to work on the front end design aspect of this.  I do not have much experience with making the site less plain but plan to work on getting better at that.
